      <h3>Rizwan Mirza</h3>
      <p> I am a 19 year old programmer currently studying for a degree in Computer Science City University of London.
          Before this, I learnt how to programme in Python over the period of two years in high school.
          I then went on to study Computer science in A-Levels and did another two years of Python.
          I came out of A-Levels with an A in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
      <p> Besides from programming, I enjoy playing FPS games such as Counter Strike and Warzone.
          I watch football and support the football team Arsenal.
          My favourite sports to play are football and cricket. Occasionally dodgeball.
          Other than that, I also love playing chess. Beating my friends at chess gives me a thrill.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Among Us Emergency Meeting</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
	City (2020). During quarantine I have been playing the game called Among Us.
  I've grown fond of the game so for this project I decided to make a portion
  of the game for my project. The project has many images imported into it.
  With these images and background i was able to put the game together. For the
  text, I used timing to output the scenario of the game over a set period of time.
  Fonts were used for my text as well as colouring for the text. To make the button
  functionable I had to make a class for it, so whenever the button gets pressed by
  the user it is very responsive. Music was integrated - one sound at the start background
  and a space music sound to give the vibes of the actual game. Once the user has chosen
  who they think the imposter is they get presented with a winning message or defeat
  message and the game ends. The program is very interactive as it asks the user
  questions and they must answer them - if they wish to see the scenario again they
  can use the button and if they want to play the game they have to the mouse button.
