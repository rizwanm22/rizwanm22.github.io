      <h3>Rizwan Mirza</h3>
      <p> I am a 19 year old programmer currently studying for a degree in Computer Science City University of London.
          Before this, I learnt how to programme in Python over the period of two years in high school.
          I then went on to study Computer science in A-Levels and did another two years of Python.
          I came out of A-Levels with an A in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
      <p> Besides from programming, I enjoy playing FPS games such as Counter Strike and Warzone.
          I watch football and support the football team Arsenal.
          My favourite sports to play are football and cricket. Occasionally dodgeball.
          Other than that, I also love playing chess. Beating my friends at chess gives me a thrill.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Among Us Emergency Meeting</h3>
    <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
	     City (2020). My project goes under the category of image processing as well as sound.
       Among us is a game that I have been playing since mid quarantine. In my project
       I have used a lot of image processing as well as sound processing. The user
       interactivity within my project is also present - and I have designed the project
       window accordingly so it does feel like the real game. I also made a fully
       functionable button. The user can play the game with their mouse alone.

     <h3>Spring Coursework 2021: Warrior vs. Villain</h3>
     <p> A java programming project produced by me at the end of our spring term. After spending
     multiple weeks on this code, it has finally come to an end. This project is a game I created
     where a warrior has to collect hearts while avoiding a villain considering he has limited
     lives. It features many body collisions that you must see for yourself. The game is quite
     simple and also fun to play.
